    "\n",
    "The key idea of MPT is to optimally balance risk and reward by diversifying investments across different assets. Let's dig into this argument by first exploring what we mean by risk and reward of a portfolio, starting with reward.\n",

    "### Portfolio Reward\n",
    "The reward of a portfolio is measured by its expected growth (return), which is the weighted average of the expected growth rates (returns) of the individual assets in the portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ consisting of $M$ assets. Let $w_i\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ be the weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio (i.e., the dollar fraction of the total portfolio value invested in asset $i$), and let $\\mathbb{E}[g_i]$ be the expected growth rate (return) of asset $i$. Then, the expected growth rate (return) of the portfolio, denoted as $\\mathbb{E}[g_{\\mathcal{P}}]$, is given by:\n",

However, the reward argument remains the same. Let $g_{\\star} = r_{\\star}/\\Delta{t}$. Then, the expected return of the portfolio is given by:\n",

The minimum variance formula provides a systematic approach to optimal asset allocation decisions.\n",
