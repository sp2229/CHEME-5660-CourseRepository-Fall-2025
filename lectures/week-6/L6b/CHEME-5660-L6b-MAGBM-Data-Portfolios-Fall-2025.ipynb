    "## Concept Review: Multiple Asset Geometric Brownian Motion (MAGBM)\n",
    "In the previous lecture, we extended the single asset geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model to describe multiple assets. The key new ingredient in the multiple asset GBM (MAGBM) model is the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ which captures how different firms' returns move together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill me in.\n",
    "\n",
    "While MAGBM is a powerful model, it requires knowledge of the covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$, which can be challenging to estimate accurately. Furthermore, we have all the caveats of GBM, such as the constant drift and volatility assumption, and the assumption of a Normal distribution of returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, suppose we wanted to use MAGBM to simulate the prices of a portfolio of assets. In that case, we need to know the fraction of the total portfolio value invested in each asset, which adds another layer of complexity, and our topic for today's lecture.\n",

    "The key idea of this approach is to optimally balance risk and reward by diversifying investments across different assets. Let's dig into this argument by frist exploring what we mean by risk and reward of a portfolio. Let's start with the reward.\n",

    "The reward of a portfolio is typically measured by its expected growth (return), which is the weighted average of the expected growth rates (returns) of the individual assets in the portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ consisting of $M$ assets. Let $w_i\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ be the weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio (i.e., the dollar fraction of the total portfolio value invested in asset $i$), and let $\\mathbb{E}[g_i]$ be the expected growth rate (return) of asset $i$. Then, the expected growth rate (return) of the portfolio, denoted as $\\mathbb{E}[g_{\\mathcal{P}}]$, is given by:\n",

    "### Portfolio Risk\n",
    "The risk of a portfolio is (typically) measured by its variance (or standard deviation) of growth rates (returns), which takes into account the variances of the individual assets as well as the covariances between them. The portfolio variance written in terms of growth rates is given by:\n",
