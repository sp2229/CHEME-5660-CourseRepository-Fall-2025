    "# Example: Yield Calculation for a Zero\n",
    "In this example, we will calculate the annualized investment yield of a zero-coupon bond given its price, face value, discount rate, and time to maturity. We'll explore how this yield relates to the discount rate used in pricing the instrument.\n",

    "> __Motivation:__ Understanding how to calculate yields from bond prices is fundamental to fixed-income analysis. For zero-coupon instruments, we'll explore how the annualized investment yield relates to the discount rate used in pricing and how yields change when market prices fluctuate. This helps investors understand the relationship between bond prices, yields, and returns.\n",
