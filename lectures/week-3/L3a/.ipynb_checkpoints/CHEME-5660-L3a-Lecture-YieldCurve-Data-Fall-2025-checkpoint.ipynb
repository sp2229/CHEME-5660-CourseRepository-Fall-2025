This provides accuracy to about 6-8 decimal places, which is sufficient for most practical applications. For YTM calculations, $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ corresponds to about 0.0001% accuracy in the yield estimate.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Maximum iterations ($\\texttt{maxiter}$)**: For well-behaved functions like the NPV equation for YTM, the secant method typically converges within 10-20 iterations. A safe choice is $\\texttt{maxiter} = 50$ to $100$. If convergence hasn't occurred by then, it usually indicates a problem with the initial guesses or the function itself.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Initial guesses**: For YTM calculations, reasonable starting values are often $x_0 = 0.01$ (1%) and $x_1 = 0.10$ (10%), which bracket typical bond yields. The secant method is generally robust to the choice of initial guesses as long as they're not too close together.\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "   where $f(x_i)$ and $f(x_{i-1})$ are the function values at the current and previous estimates, respectively.\n",
    "2. Check for convergence: if $|x_{i+1} - x_i| < \\epsilon$, set $\\texttt{converged}\\gets\\texttt{true}$. Otherwise, continue iterating. If the maximum number of iterations is reached without convergence, return the best solution found so far and warn the user.\n",

    "__Convergence Properties for YTM Calculations:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The secant method exhibits **superlinear convergence** (meaning the error decreases faster than linearly with each iteration) with convergence order approximately 1.618 (the golden ratio; this measures how rapidly the accuracy improves). This makes it faster than simple linear methods but slower than Newton's method (which has quadratic convergence order 2.0).\n",
