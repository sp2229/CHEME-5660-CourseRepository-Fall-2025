Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York City and is the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.\n",

    "> **Business model.** Goldman Sachs operates through three primary business segments: Global Banking & Markets (investment banking advisory, securities underwriting, and trading), Asset & Wealth Management (portfolio management for institutions and individuals), and Platform Solutions (consumer banking and transaction services). The firm provides market-making services across multiple asset classes and maintains significant trading operations alongside traditional investment banking activities.\n",

    "* **Research contributions:** Goldman Sachs researchers introduced the BRIC economies concept (Brazil, Russia, India, China) in a 2003 economics paper that analyzed growth factors for emerging markets. The firm also created the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) in 1994, a widely-used benchmark that represents systematic exposure to commodity markets—effectively a commodity factor in asset allocation.\n",

While the fund closed after the 2008 financial crisis, it represented sophisticated application of quantitative methods including multi-factor models.\n",
