    "# L7a: Introduction to Single Index Models (SIMs)\n",
    "In this lecture, we explore Single Index Models (SIMs) in the context of financial markets. SIMs are a simplified approach to modeling the relationship between a security's returns (growth rate) and the returns (growth rate) of a __market index__.\n",

    "> __Learning Objectives:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> By the end of this lecture, you will be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following key concepts:\n",
    "> * __Factor models__ describe the relationship between a security's returns and the returns of a market index, and other factors, such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth, etc.\n",
    "> * __Single Index Models (SIMs)__ are a type of factor model that simplifies the relationship between a security's returns and the returns of a market index by assuming that the security's returns are linearly related to the returns of the market index.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose the growth of firm $i$ at time $t$ is denoted by $\\mu^{(t)}_{i}$.

    "\n",
    "### Example: The Fama-French Three-Factor Model\n",
    "One of the most influential extensions of the single-factor approach is the Fama-French three-factor model. The development of this model began with Fama and French's empirical work in 1992 demonstrating the limitations of CAPM, followed by their formal introduction of the three-factor model in 1993:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fama-French model has three specific factors: the market factor (similar to our market index $\\mu^{(t)}_{M}$), a size factor that captures the return difference between small-cap and large-cap stocks, and a value factor that captures the return difference between high book-to-market (value) and low book-to-market (growth) stocks. Mathematically, the model can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r^{(t)}_{i} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}r^{(t)}_{M} + s_{i}\\;\\text{SMB}^{(t)} + h_{i}\\;\\text{HML}^{(t)} + \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i},\n",

    "\n",
    "This three-factor structure has proven successful in explaining cross-sectional variation in stock returns. In their foundational 1992 study, Fama and French demonstrated that portfolios formed on size and book-to-market characteristics could explain over 90% of the variation in diversified portfolio returns, compared with the average 70% given by the CAPM. The model's success stems from its ability to capture fundamental economic relationships: smaller companies tend to be riskier and thus command higher expected returns, while value stocks (those with high book-to-market ratios) often represent distressed companies that also require higher expected returns to compensate investors for the additional risk.\n",
