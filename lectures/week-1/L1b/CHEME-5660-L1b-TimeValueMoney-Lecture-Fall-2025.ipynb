    "# L1b: Time Value of Money, Abstract Assets and the Net Present Value\n",
    "Today, we’ll introduce the concepts of _Abstract Assets_ and the _Time Value of Money_. These concepts are foundational to understanding finance and investment, and we'll see them over and over again throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture students should be able to define and demonstrate the following concepts:\n",
    "* __Time value of money__: The time value of money is the change in buying power over time. Money, and more specifically, its value or buying power, is not conserved like mass, momentum, or energy. The change (more often than not decrease) is called the Time Value of Money (TVM). How do we capture this change? We can use the concept of _discounting_ to capture the change in value over time.\n",
    "* __Abstract Asset__: An abstract asset is a series of current and future cash flows. This framework can model the value of everything you consider an asset, such as cash, stocks, and bonds, or physical assets, such as a car or house.\n",
    "* __Net Present Value (NPV)__: The net present value is the sum of all current and future cash flows, discounted to the present. NPV is a useful tool for evaluating investments and making financial decisions. A positive NPV indicates that the investment is expected to generate more cashflow than benchmark risk-free investments, while a negative NPV indicates the opposite.\n",

    "## Time Value of Money\n",
    "The time value of money is the principle that a dollar today has greater purchasing power than the same dollar received in the future. But _why_ does money lose value over time? \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why Money Loses Value**: Inflation eats away purchasing power (3% inflation means $100 today = $97 buying power next year). Opportunity cost means money today can earn returns (miss out on 5% = lose $5 per $100). Risk means future payments might not happen (bird in the hand vs. two in the bush). And impatience, people prefer money now due to psychological preference for immediate gratification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: a dollar today > a dollar tomorrow. Always. Let's look at how we can capture this mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Present and Future Value\n",

    "\n",
    "The right-hand side $P$ is the present value (PV) (value of the investment today), while the left-hand side $F$ is the investment's future value (FV). The connection between the present and future value is made through the _discount factor_ $\\mathcal{D}(r) = (1+r)$. \n",
    "* _Discount factor_: The present value $P$ and the future value $F$ are related through the compounding (discount) factor $\\mathcal{D}(r) = (1+r) > 1$. Different models exist for $\\mathcal{D}(\\cdot)$, e.g., discrete or continuous, single or multiple step discount factors, etc.\n",
    "* _What is r_?: The value of the fractional rate of return $r$, and the probability of achieving that level of return varies with investment type. The fractional rate of return $r$ has many names, it is often called the discount rate, the interest rate, etc, depending on the context."
