    "## Exchanges, Stocks and ETFs\n",
    "Before diving into the analysis of returns and risk, let's establish a foundation by defining the key players and instruments in equity markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Exchange?\n",
    "An __exchange__ is an organized marketplace where securities, commodities, derivatives, and other financial instruments are traded between buyers and sellers. In the context of equity securities, exchanges serve as the infrastructure that facilitates the buying and selling of stocks and ETFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Functions of an Exchange:__\n",
    "> * __Price Discovery and Liquidity__: Exchanges aggregate buy and sell orders to determine fair market prices through supply and demand while bringing together many buyers and sellers to ensure efficient trading. In the U.S., this process is enhanced by the __National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)__ system, which consolidates the best available bid and ask prices across all exchanges and market centers for each security.\n",
    "> * __Market Regulation__: Exchanges enforce trading rules, listing standards, and disclosure requirements to maintain fair and orderly markets.\n",
    "> * __Settlement and Clearing__: Exchanges facilitate the transfer of securities and funds between parties to complete transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States has __16 registered national securities exchanges__ as of 2025, with the three largest being the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](https://www.nyse.com/), [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/), and [Cboe BZX Exchange](https://www.cboe.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "When you trade, you are really trading on all of these exchanges simultaneously because of something called the __National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)__ system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __NBBO and Market Structure:__\n",
    "> The NBBO represents the highest bid price and lowest ask price available across all U.S. exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems (ATS). For example, if Stock `XYZ` has a bid of 50.00 on NYSE and 50.01 on NASDAQ, while the ask is 50.05 on NYSE and 50.04 on NASDAQ, the NBBO would be 50.01 × 50.04. Brokers must either match or improve upon these prices when executing customer orders. This system promotes competition between trading venues and helps ensure fair pricing for all market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other notable exchanges include IEX, NYSE Arca, NASDAQ BX, and various Cboe-operated venues, all competing to provide the best execution for different types of securities and trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Stock?\n",
    "A __stock__ (also called a __share__ or __equity security__) represents fractional ownership in a corporation. When you purchase stock, you become a shareholder and own a piece of that company.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Characteristics of Stocks:__\n",
    "> * __Ownership Rights__: Stockholders typically have voting rights on major corporate decisions, such as electing the board of directors.\n",
    "> * __Dividend Potential__: Some stocks pay dividends, which are periodic distributions of company profits to shareholders.\n",
    "> * __Capital Appreciation__: Stock prices can increase over time, providing capital gains when sold at a higher price than purchased.\n",
    "> * __Limited Liability__: Shareholders' potential losses are limited to their investment amount; they are not personally liable for company debts.\n",
    "> * __Residual Claims__: In the event of liquidation, stockholders have claims on company assets only after all creditors and bondholders are paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Types of Common Stocks:__\n",
    "Stocks are categorized as __growth__ (fast-growing earnings), __value__ (trading below intrinsic value), __dividend__ (regular profit distributions), or __blue-chip__ (large, established companies).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an ETF?\n",
    "An __Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)__ is an investment fund that trades on stock exchanges like individual stocks but holds a diversified portfolio of underlying assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or other securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Characteristics of ETFs:__\n",
    "> * __Diversification__: ETFs typically hold dozens or hundreds of different securities, reducing concentration risk.\n",
    "> * __Transparency__: ETF holdings are disclosed daily, allowing investors to know exactly what assets they own.\n",
    "> * __Liquidity__: ETFs can be bought and sold throughout trading hours at market prices, unlike mutual funds which price once daily.\n",
    "> * __Lower Costs__: ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed mutual funds.\n",
    "> * __Tax Efficiency__: ETFs typically generate fewer taxable events than mutual funds due to their structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Popular ETF Categories:__ The most common types include index ETFs that track market indices like the S&P 500 ([SPY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY)) or NASDAQ 100 ([QQQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QQQ)), sector ETFs focused on specific industries such as technology or healthcare, and international ETFs providing exposure to foreign markets. Additionally, investors can access bond ETFs for fixed-income exposure and commodity ETFs that track prices of gold, oil, or agricultural products.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the key for us today is that ETFs trade like stocks on exchanges, making them a convenient way to gain diversified exposure to various asset classes. \n",

    "## Stylized Facts of Equity Returns\n",
    "Analysts and investors gain insights into market behavior, risk, and investment opportunities by examining returns and their properties (stylized facts). While several stylized facts have been developed, let’s consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Heavy (also called fat) tailed distribution__: Stock returns often exhibit a distribution with fatter tails than would be expected under a normal distribution. This means that extreme price movements are more likely than would be predicted by a normal distribution.\n",
    "* __Absence of Autocorrelation__: Autocorrelation refers to the tendency of stock returns to correlate with past returns over time. Autocorrelation suggests predictability in returns, which traders could exploit. On the other hand, a random walk is uncorrelated with itself. We expect a random walk with occasional jumps.\n",
    "* __Volatility clustering__: Stock returns tend to be more volatile during specific periods and less volatile during others. This phenomenon is known as volatility clustering, suggesting that large price movements are more likely to be followed by other large moves, and other small moves follow small moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not the only stylized facts of equity returns, but they are among the most widely recognized and studied. For more details, see the following references:\n",

These _black swans_, such as the 1987 crash, 2008 crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, or April 2025 tariff sell-offs, arise from larger systemic failures, or sudden news, earnings surprises, or geopolitical shocks.\n",

Incorporating clustering improves risk forecasts, option valuations, hedging strategies, and capital allocation decisions.\n",
