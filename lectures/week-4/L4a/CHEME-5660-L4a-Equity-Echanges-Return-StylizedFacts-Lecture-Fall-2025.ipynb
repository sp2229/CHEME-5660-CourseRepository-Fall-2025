    "# L4a: Equity Exchanges, Return, and Stylized Facts\n",
    "Today, we will introduce our next asset class: __equity securities__. Equity securities (stock and Exchange Traded Funds - ETFs) are traded on exchanges (secondary markets) with several players and components. We’ll also introduce the log return and explore its stylized facts (statistical properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you will be able to define and demonstrate mastery of the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Equity securities__ represent ownership in a corporation, entitling shareholders to a portion of the company's profits and assets, with the potential for capital gains and voting rights, while exposing them to the risks associated with the company's performance.\n",
    "* The __log return__ of a stock price is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the stock's price at the end of a period to its price at the beginning of that period, providing a measure of continuously compounded returns that can be easily aggregated over time\n",
    "* __Stylized facts__ refer to empirical statistical properties of asset returns across various financial markets, such as heavy tails, volatility clustering, and the lack of autocorrelation. These serve as essential guidelines for developing and validating financial models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity securities are what everyone thinks of when they think of the stock market. They have a higher-risk reward profile than fixed income securities, such as bonds. Thus, there is lot of interest in understanding in the _uncertainty_ of equity price. This is a cool topic area, so let's get started!\n",

    "## Risk\n",
    "The risk of an investment is the uncertainty associated with the potential for loss or gain. \n",
    "> __Risk:__ We can quantify risk using a variety of statistical measures, but the most common is the __standard deviation__ of the continuously compounded excess growth rate $\\bar{\\mu}$, which we denote as $\\sigma_{\\bar{\\mu}}$ (units: inverse years). The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or variability of the returns around their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a time series of continuously compounded excess growth rates $\\left\\{\\bar{\\mu}_2,\\bar{\\mu}_3,\\ldots,\\bar{\\mu}_{T}\\right\\}$ for a stock (note: we have $T-1$ return observations from $T$ price observations). The sample standard deviation of the continuously compounded excess growth rate, i.e., our risk measure, is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\bar{\\mu}} &= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(T-1) - 1}\\sum_{t=2}^{T}\\left(\\bar{\\mu}_t - \\bar{\\mu}^{\\prime}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T - 2}\\sum_{t=2}^{T}\\left(\\bar{\\mu}_t - \\bar{\\mu}^{\\prime}\\right)^2}\n",

The denominator $T-2$ represents the degrees of freedom for the sample standard deviation: $(T-1) - 1 = T-2$. We'll typically compute the standard deviation using [the `std(...)` method exported by the `Statistics.jl` package](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Statistics/#Statistics.std).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Risk Measures\n",
    "While standard deviation (volatility) is the most commonly used risk measure, it's important to note that risk can be quantified in many ways, each capturing different aspects of uncertainty:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Value at Risk (VaR)__: The maximum potential loss over a specific time period at a given confidence level (e.g., 5% chance of losing more than $X in one day).\n",
    "* __Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)__: Also known as Expected Shortfall, it measures the average loss beyond the VaR threshold, providing information about tail risk.\n",
    "* __Maximum Drawdown__: The largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value, measuring the worst-case scenario an investor would have experienced.\n",
    "* __Beta__: A measure of systematic risk that quantifies how much an asset's returns move relative to the overall market. We'll for sure see $\\beta$ in __many__ future lectures and exercises.\n",
    "* __Downside Deviation__: Similar to standard deviation but only considers negative returns, focusing on the risk of losses rather than overall volatility.\n",
    "* __Tracking Error__: The standard deviation of the difference between an investment's returns and its benchmark, measuring relative risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of risk measure depends on the specific application, investor preferences, and the aspects of risk that are most relevant to the investment decision. In this course, we'll primarily focus on standard deviation due to its mathematical tractability, but we'll see a few of these alternative risk measures in future lectures.\n",

    "## Stylized Facts of Equity Returns\n",
    "Analysts and investors gain insights into market behavior, risk, and investment opportunities by examining returns and their properties (stylized facts). While several stylized facts have been developed, let’s consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Heavy (also called fat) tailed distribution__: Stock returns often exhibit a distribution with fatter tails than would be expected under a normal distribution. This means that extreme price movements are more likely than would be predicted by a normal distribution.\n",
    "* __Absence of Autocorrelation__: Autocorrelation refers to the tendency of stock returns to correlate with past returns over time. Autocorrelation suggests predictability in returns, which traders could exploit. On the other hand, a random walk is uncorrelated with itself. We expect a random walk with occasional jumps.\n",
    "* __Volatility clustering__: Stock returns tend to be more volatile during specific periods and less volatile during others. This phenomenon is known as volatility clustering, suggesting that large price movements are more likely to be followed by other large moves, and other small moves follow small moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at each of these stylized facts in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Note on Stylized Facts:__ These three stylized facts are empirically observed across many financial markets and time periods, but they are not independent phenomena. For example, heavy tails and volatility clustering are often related—periods of high volatility tend to produce more extreme returns, contributing to the heavy-tailed nature of return distributions. Understanding these interconnections helps in developing more realistic models of financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heavy Tailed Return Distributions\n",
    "Heavy‐tailed distributions have probability of extreme deviations that decays more slowly than exponentially, making large shocks rarer but much more likely than under a Normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Black swan events__: Heavy tails in stock‐return distributions create extreme jumps far more frequent than Normal distributions predict. These _black swans_—such as the 1987 crash, 2008 crisis, or COVID-19 sell-off—arise from sudden news, earnings surprises, or geopolitical shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **heavy-tailed distribution** has tails that are not exponentially bounded. For random variable $X$, tail probabilities decay more slowly than exponential:\n",

    "\\mathbb{P}(|X| > x) \\sim L(x)\\,x^{-\\alpha}, \\quad \\text{as } x \\to \\infty,\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Tail index__: \n",
    "> The tail index $\\alpha$ is a key parameter in characterizing the heaviness of the tail. It determines how quickly the tail probabilities decay. \n",
    "> A smaller $\\alpha$ indicates a heavier tail, while a larger $\\alpha$ indicates a lighter tail. Here's a guide:\n",
    "> * If $\\alpha < 2$, the distribution is considered **heavy-tailed** in the strict sense.\n",
    "> * If $\\alpha < 1$, the distribution is **very heavy-tailed** (e.g., financial crashes, Cauchy).\n",
    "> * If $\\alpha > 4$, the distribution is often treated as **effectively light-tailed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hill's estimator of the tail index\n",
    "Hill's estimator is a method for estimating the tail index $\\alpha$ of a heavy-tailed distribution. \n",

The (empirical) autocorrelation sequence (where we neglect the firm superscript for simplicity) is given by:\n",

In this case, the autocorrelation function (ACF) of stock returns would be close to zero for all lags $k > 0$. This suggests that stock prices are unpredictable and follow a random walk.\n",
