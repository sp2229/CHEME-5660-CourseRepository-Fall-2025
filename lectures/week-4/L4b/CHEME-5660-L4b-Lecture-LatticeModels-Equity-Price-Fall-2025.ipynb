The autocorrelation function for the multiple step growth rate distribution $\\mu_{t}$ is not zero, but instead decays as the lag $\\tau$ increases.

    "The binomial lattice return (growth rate) model does __not__ capture volatility clustering. We are not going to derive this result, but here is the intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Result:__ No volatility clustering. One of the key assumptions of the binomial lattice model is that the up and down factors $u$ and $d$, and the probability $p$ are constant over time. This means that the volatility of returns is also constant over time, which contradicts the empirical observation of volatility clustering in financial markets.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduced the binomial lattice model for equity share prices. We discussed how to estimate the model parameters using a data-driven approach. Finally, we explored whether the binomial lattice model captures any of the stylized facts observed in real market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways__\n",
    "> * A __binomial lattice model__ assumes that tomorrow exists in one of two possible states: up or down. From today, we move to the up-state with probability p and the down-state with probability (1 - p).\n",
    "> * __Lattice model parameters__: There are two possible approaches for the lattice parameters. A real-world probability approach assumes we estimate parameters from data. A risk-neutral probability approach assumes a particular model for the lattice parameters (we'll explore this in a future lecture).\n",
    "> * __Stylized facts__: Stylized facts refer to empirical statistical properties of asset returns across various financial markets, such as heavy tails, volatility clustering, and the lack of autocorrelation. These serve as essential guidelines for developing and validating financial models. The binomial lattice model captures the absence of autocorrelation for one-step returns, but does not capture heavy tails or volatility clustering.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> While lattice models are not the most sophisticated models available, they are easy to understand and implement, and are surprisingly effective in capturing the essential features of equity share prices.\n",
