    "## Covered Calls\n",
    "A covered call is an options strategy where an investor holds a long position in an asset and sells call options on that same asset to generate income from the option premiums. This strategy is typically used when the investor expects the underlying asset's price to remain relatively stable or to increase slightly.\n",

    "### Analysis of Covered Calls\n",
    "Suppose a composite contract $\\mathcal{C}$ with legs $i=1,\\dots,|\\mathcal{C}|$ is constructed using American-style options contracts on the same underlying firm (share price $S$) with the same expiration date $T$. \n",
    "If you hold $\\theta_{i}n_i$ contracts of leg $i$ ($\\theta = 1$ for long, and $\\theta = -1$ for short) and the contract multiplier is $m$ shares/contract, and you also hold $N_S$ shares of the stock, then your portfolio value at time $t$ is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pi(S,t)=N_S S+m\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{C}|} \\theta_i n_i \\mathcal{P}_i(S,t),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For a covered call, you would have $N_S = m n_{\\text{call}}$ shares of the stock, the $\\theta_{\\text{call}} = -1$ (since you are selling the call option) and you have no other legs in the composite contract, i.e., $|\\mathcal{C}|=1$. Thus, for a covered call, the portfolio value simplifies to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pi(S,t)=m n_{\\text{call}} S - m n_{\\text{call}} \\mathcal{P}_{\\text{call}}(S,t).\n",
