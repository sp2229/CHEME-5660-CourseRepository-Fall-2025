    "## Covered Calls\n",
    "A covered call is an options strategy where an investor holds a long position in an asset and sells call options on that same asset to generate income from the option premiums. This strategy is typically used when the investor expects the underlying asset's price to remain relatively stable or to increase slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's watch a short video explaining the basics of covered calls from SMB Capital: [Simple & Low Risk Investing Strategy](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=Tid1rfVIc9c).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Naked calls:__ Of course, you can benefit from selling call options without owning the underlying asset, but this is known as a __naked call__ which carries undefined downside risk. In contrast, a covered call limits potential losses because the investor already owns the underlying asset at some cost basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you don't need to do this yourself. Let's check out a few covered call ETFs: [Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD)](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/qyld/) or the [REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF](https://www.rexshares.com/fang/).\n",

    "> $$\\Delta^{(p)}_j(S^{(j)}(t),K_{j}) = 0$$\n",

    "> Since put option Deltas are negative and approach zero as they move out of the money, this condition is satisfied when the short put contract is __deep out of the money__, i.e., when $S^{(j)}(t) \\gg K_{j}$, and thus $\\Delta^{(p)}_j \\approx 0$. In this scenario, the put option has minimal sensitivity to the underlying stock price movements. The position effectively has no directional exposure because the probability of exercise is negligible, and the option's value changes very little with small stock price movements.\n",

    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __Covered calls combine stock ownership with short call options:__ The portfolio value includes cash, stock, and short call positions. At expiration, the profit depends on whether the stock price exceeds the strike price. If exercised, shares are sold at the strike price resulting in a realized gain. If the call expires worthless, the investor retains the shares and the premium as unrealized gain.\n",
    "> * __Cash secured puts generate income without initial stock ownership:__ The portfolio value includes cash and short put positions. At expiration, if the stock price stays above the strike price, the put expires worthless and the premium is kept as a realized gain. If the stock price falls below the strike price, the investor must buy shares at the strike price resulting in a realized loss offset by the premium received.\n",
    "> * __Portfolio Delta combines stock and options contributions:__ The net Delta equals the stock position plus the weighted option Delta for each leg. This calculation uses the Kronecker delta to isolate contributions from specific legs when portfolios contain multiple positions.\n",
