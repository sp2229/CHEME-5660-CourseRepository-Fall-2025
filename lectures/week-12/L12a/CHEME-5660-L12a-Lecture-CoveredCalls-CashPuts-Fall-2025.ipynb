    "## Covered Calls\n",
    "A covered call is an options strategy where an investor holds a long position in an asset and sells call options on that same asset to generate income from the option premiums. This strategy is typically used when the investor expects the underlying asset's price to remain relatively stable or to increase slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's watch a short video explaining the basics of covered calls from SMB Capital: [Simple & Low Risk Investing Strategy](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=Tid1rfVIc9c).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can benefit from selling call options without owning the underlying asset, but this is known as a naked call and carries significantly higher risk. In contrast, a covered call limits potential losses because the investor already owns the underlying asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you don't need to do this yourself, let's check out a few covered call ETFs: [Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD)](https://www.globalxetfs.com/funds/qyld/) or the [REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF](https://www.rexshares.com/fang/).\n",

    "### Analysis of Covered Call Portfolios\n",
    "Let's look at a general FEPI style covered call portfolio containing $|\\mathcal{C}|$ legs of American-style __short call__ contracts on an underlying asset, all contracts have the same expiration date $T$ (which we assume is short enough to ignore time-value of money issues). The portfolio value consists of three terms: a cash position, a stock position, and an options position.\n",
    "* __Cash Position:__ The cash position is simply the amount of cash held in the portfolio, denoted as $N_C$. This could be positive (cash held) or negative (cash borrowed). For now, we'll only consider $N_{C}\\geq{0}$ (no borrowing).\n",
    "* __Stock Position:__ The stock position is the value of the shares of the underlying stock $i$ held in the portfolio, denoted as $N^{(i)}_S S^{(i)}(t)$, where $N^{(i)}_S$ is the number of shares held of stock $i$ and $S^{(i)}(t)$ is the current share price of stock $i$ at time $t$.\n",
    "* __Options Position:__ The options position is the value of the options contracts held in the portfolio, denoted as $m \\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{C}|} \\theta_i n_i \\mathcal{P}_i(S,t)$, where $m$ is the contract multiplier (shares per contract), $\\theta_i$ indicates long ($1$) or short ($-1$) position, $n_i$ is the number of contracts, and $\\mathcal{P}_i(S,t)$ is the price of the option leg $i$ at time $t$.\n",
