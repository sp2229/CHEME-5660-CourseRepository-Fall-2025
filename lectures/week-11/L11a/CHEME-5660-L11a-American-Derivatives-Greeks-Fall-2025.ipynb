    "The central question we will address in this lecture is: \"How do American options premiums change with market conditions?\" To answer this, we will explore the sensitivity of American options premiums to various factors, including: underlying asset price, volatility, time to expiration, interest rates (risk-free rate), and dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __The Greeks:__ The Greeks are a set of measures that describe how the price of an option changes in response to changes in various parameters. They are __essential__ tools for options traders and risk managers to assess and manage the risks associated with options positions.\n",

    "### Theta $\\Theta$: Time decay and its impact on options premium.\n",
    "The $\\Theta$ of an option measures the sensitivity of the option's price to the passage of time. It represents the rate at which the option's premium decreases as the expiration date approaches, all else being equal. This phenomenon is known as time decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time decay is particularly important for American options, as they can be exercised at any time before expiration. As time passes, the likelihood of the option finishing in-the-money changes, and this is reflected in the option's premium. Generally, the closer an option is to expiration, the faster its time decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vega $\\nu$: Understanding Volatility's role in options pricing.\n",
    "The $\\nu$ of an option measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the implied volatility of the underlying asset. What is the implied volatility? \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Implied Volatility (IV):__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Implied volatility is the market's expectation of the future annualized volatility of the underlying asset. It is derived from the market price of the option itself, using an options pricing model (e.g., CRR). Higher IV generally leads to higher option premiums, as it increases the potential for larger price movements in the underlying asset. In general, the IV is larger than the historical volatility (HV) of the underlying asset, as it includes a risk premium for uncertainty about future price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the IV to get a __back of the envelope estimate__ of the expected price range of the underlying asset over a given time horizon. For example, suppose the current price of the underlying asset is $S_{0}$, and the implied volatility is $\\sigma_{IV}$ (written as a decimal). Over a time horizon of $T$-days, we can estimate the expected price range of the underlying asset as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "S_{T} & \\approx S_{0}\\left(1 \\pm z_{\\alpha}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{252}}\\right)\\sigma_{IV}\\right)\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $z_{\\alpha}$ is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., for a 95% confidence level, $z_{\\alpha} \\approx 1.96$), and 252 is the typical number of trading days in a year. Let's check out a quick example of the IV using our NVDA options data.\n",

    "## The Many Secret Lives of Delta $\\Delta$.\n",
    "The $\\Delta$ of an option measures how much the price of the option changes for a +1 dollar change in the price of the underlying asset. However, it has two other important interpretations:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Delta Interpretations:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __Hedging Ratio:__ Delta can be interpreted as the number of shares of the underlying asset needed to hedge one option contract. For example, if an option contract has $\\pm\\Delta$, it means that for every $n$ contracts held, an investor would need to hold $\\mp{100}\\cdot{n_{i}}\\cdot\\Delta$ shares of the underlying asset to be delta-neutral. A delta-neutral position is one where the overall portfolio value is insensitive to small changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n",
    "> * __Probability Measure:__ Delta can also be interpreted as the probability that the option will expire in-the-money. For example, a delta of 0.7 for a call option suggests a 70% chance that the option will be exercised profitably at expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\Delta$ of American options is bounded $\\Delta_{\\tau}\\in\\left[-1,1\\right]$, where the negative values may seem a little strange given the probability interpretation. However, this is because we can be __long__ or __short__ an option contract, which affects the sign of $\\Delta$."
