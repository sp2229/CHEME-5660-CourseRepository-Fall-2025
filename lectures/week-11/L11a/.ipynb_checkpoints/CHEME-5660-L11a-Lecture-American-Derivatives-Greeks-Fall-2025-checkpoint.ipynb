    "In the last lecture, we did a deep dive into American options premium and its components: intrinsic value and extrinsic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Intrinsic Value__: The intrinsic value of an American option is the immediate exercise value. For a call option, it's calculated as $\\max(0, S_{t} - K)$, where $S_{t}$ is the current stock price and $K$ is the strike price. For a put option, it's $\\max(0, K - S_{t})$.\n",
    "* __Extrinsic Value__: The extrinsic value, also known as time value, represents the additional value of the option based on the potential for future price movements before expiration. It is calculated as the difference between the total option price and its intrinsic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extrinsic value $E_{V}(t)$ can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "E_{V}(t) = \\text{Option Price} - \\text{Intrinsic Value}\\quad\\blacksquare\n",

    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align*}}\n",

    "The central question we will address in this lecture is: \"How do American options premiums change with market conditions?\" To answer this, we will explore the sensitivity of American options premiums to various factors, including underlying asset price, volatility, time to expiration, interest rates (risk-free rate), and dividends.\n",

    "> - **Delta ($\\Delta$)**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to a `+1 USD/share` change in the underlying asset's price. However, $\\Delta$ also represents the hedge ratio, i.e., the number of shares of the underlying asset needed to hedge one option contract, and the probability that the option will finish in-the-money at expiration.\n",
    "> - **Theta ($\\Theta$)**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to a `1-day decrease` in the lifetime of the contract (time decay). Theta benefits option sellers, as options lose value as expiration approaches, all else being equal.\n",
    "> - **Vega ($\\nu$)**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to a `+1%` change in the volatility of the underlying asset. The higher the volatility, the higher the option premium, as there is a greater chance of significant price movements.\n",
    "> - **Gamma ($\\Gamma$)**: Measures the sensitivity of $\\Delta$ to a `+1 USD/share` change in the underlying asset's price. This is the second derivative of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price.\n",
    "> - **Rho ($\\rho$)**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to a `+1%` change in the risk-free interest rate. This is generally a minor effect for most options, but can be more significant for longer-term options.\n",

    "## The Secret Lives of Delta $\\Delta$\n",

    "> __Delta Interpretations:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __Hedging Ratio:__ Delta can be interpreted as the number of shares of the underlying asset needed to hedge one option contract. For example, if an option contract has $\\Delta$, it means that for every $n$ contracts held, an investor would need to hold ${100}\\cdot{n}\\cdot\\Delta$ shares of the underlying asset to be delta-neutral. A delta-neutral position is one where the overall portfolio value is insensitive to small changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n",
    "> * __Probability of Exercise:__ Delta can also be interpreted as the probability that the option will expire in-the-money (ITM). For example, a delta of 0.7 for a call option suggests a 70% chance that the share price at expiration will be at least one cent above the strike price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen an example of the hedge ratio interpretation of $\\Delta$ in the last example notebook. Let's look at the probability interpretation of $\\Delta$. In particular, we can use $\\Delta$ to estimate the probability of exercise: \n",

    "> __Probability of Exercise (POE):__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The probability of exercise (POE) is the probability that at the __expiration of the (composite or single) contract__ at time $t = T$, the share price of the underlying asset $S_{T}$ is at least `0.01` USD/share greater than the strike price $K$ of the (composite or single) contract, i.e.,\n",

    "\\end{align*}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "> We'll check the conjecture that $\\Delta \\approx \\text{POE}$ using an example.\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __The Greeks quantify option price sensitivity:__ Delta measures sensitivity to underlying price changes, Theta captures time decay, Vega measures volatility sensitivity, Rho tracks interest rate sensitivity, and Gamma measures the rate of change in Delta. These measures are derived from the total differential of the options premium function evaluated at current market conditions.\n",
    "> * __Delta serves three distinct purposes:__ Delta represents the rate of change in option price per dollar change in underlying price, determines the hedge ratio for constructing delta-neutral positions, and approximates the probability that the option will expire in-the-money.\n",
    "> * __Probability of profit differs from probability of exercise:__ Probability of exercise estimates whether the option will finish in-the-money at expiration, while probability of profit accounts for the premium paid and estimates whether the position will generate a net profit at expiration.\n",
