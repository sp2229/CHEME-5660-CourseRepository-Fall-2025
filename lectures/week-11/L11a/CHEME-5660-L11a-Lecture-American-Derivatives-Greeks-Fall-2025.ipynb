    "* __Intrinsic Value__: The intrinsic value of an American option is the __immediate exercise value__. For a call option, it's calculated as $\\max(0, S - K)$, where $S$ is the current stock price and $K$ is the strike price. For a put option, it's $\\max(0, K - S)$.\n",
    "* __Extrinsic Value__: The extrinsic value, also known as time value, represents the additional value of the option based on the potential for future price movements before expiration. It is calculated as the difference between the total option price and its intrinsic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extrinsic value $E_{V}(t)$ can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "> - **Gamma ($\\Gamma$)**: Measures the sensitivity of $\\Delta$ to changes in a `+1 USD/share` change in the underlying asset's price. This is the second derivative of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price.\n",
    "> - **Rho ($\\rho$)**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to a `+1%` change in the risk-free interest rate. This is generally a minor effect for most options, but can be more significant for longer-term options.\n",

In general, the IV is larger than the historical volatility (HV) of the underlying asset, as it includes a risk premium for uncertainty about future price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the IV to get a __back of the envelope estimate__ of the expected price range of the underlying asset over a given time horizon. For example, suppose the current price of the underlying asset is $S_{0}$, and the implied volatility is $\\sigma_{IV}$ (written as a decimal). Over a time horizon of $T$-days, we can estimate the expected price range of the underlying asset as:\n",

A delta-neutral position is one where the overall portfolio value is insensitive to small changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n",
