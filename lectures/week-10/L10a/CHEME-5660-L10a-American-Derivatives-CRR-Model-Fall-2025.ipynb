    "\n",
    "The CRR model assumes that the movement of the share price of the underlying asset can be modeled as a binomial tree, where at each time step, the price can either move up by a factor of $u$ or down by a factor of $d$. The probability of an up move is the __risk-neutral probability__ $q$, and the probability of a down move is $(1-q)$.\n",

The risk-neutral probability $q$ is derived such that the expected return of the underlying asset matches the risk-free rate $\\bar{r}$. The $u$ and $d$ parameters are derived based on the volatility $\\sigma$ of the underlying asset and the time step $\\Delta{t}$.\n",

    "Let's take a look at the binomial lattice model in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binomial Lattice Model\n",
    "A binomial lattice model is a discrete-time model used to represent the evolution of an asset's price over time. \n",
    "> __Binomial Lattice Model__: A binomial lattice model assumes that at each time step, the asset can either move up by a factor $u$ with a probability $q$ or down by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-q)$, creating a tree-like structure of possible future prices. At time $t\\geq{0}$ there will be $t+1$ possible prices. \n",

    "Suppose we have a stock with an initial price $S_0$ at time $t=0$ (today). Assuming a binomial lattice model, at $t = 1$ (tomorrow), the stock can occupy one of two possible states: the up state with a price $S^{(+)}_{1} = S_{0}\\;u$ with probability $q$ or the down state with price $S^{(-)}_{1} = S_{0}\\;d$ with probability $(1-q)$. \n",

Thus, we have a sequence of $t$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes: up or down. This sequence of trials can be represented as a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a path from the root ($t=0$) to any node at level $t$. This path consists of exactly $t$ moves, where each move is either up or down. Let $k$ be the number of up moves and $(t-k)$ be the number of down moves. The price at any node with $k$ up moves and $(t-k)$ down moves is:\n",
