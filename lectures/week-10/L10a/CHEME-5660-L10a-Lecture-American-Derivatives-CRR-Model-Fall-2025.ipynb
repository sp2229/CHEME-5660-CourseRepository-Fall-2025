    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lecture, we've explored American style options contracts and the Cox, Ross, Rubinstein (CRR) binomial model for pricing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __American options allow early exercise__ unlike European options, which can only be exercised at expiration, requiring pricing models that incorporate optimal exercise timing decisions.\n",
    "> * __The CRR binomial model discretizes asset price evolution__ using a lattice structure where prices move up or down with risk-neutral probabilities derived from the underlying asset's volatility and the risk-free rate.\n",
    "> * __Binomial pricing uses backward induction__ to compute option values at each node of the lattice, comparing the intrinsic value of immediate exercise with the expected value of holding the option for American contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering the CRR model provides a foundation for understanding more complex option pricing techniques and real-world derivative valuation.\n",
