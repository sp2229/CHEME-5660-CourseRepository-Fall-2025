    "This example demonstrates how the binomial lattice model prices American put options by building discrete price trees and working backward through time to determine optimal exercise decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * __Binomial lattices discretize price paths:__ The binomial model creates a lattice of possible future stock prices using specified up/down move magnitudes and probabilities, providing a discrete approximation of continuous price evolution over multiple time steps.\n",
    "> * __Backward induction evaluates American features:__ American option prices are calculated by working backward from expiration, at each node comparing the immediate exercise value (intrinsic value) to the discounted expected value of continuing to hold the option (extrinsic value).\n",
    "> * __Node decisions determine optimal exercise:__ At each lattice node, the algorithm chooses between exercising immediately or holding based on which action maximizes value, capturing the early exercise feature that makes American options more valuable than European options.\n",

    "Understanding how binomial lattices model American option pricing provides insight into the trade-offs between immediate exercise and future potential in option valuation.\n",
