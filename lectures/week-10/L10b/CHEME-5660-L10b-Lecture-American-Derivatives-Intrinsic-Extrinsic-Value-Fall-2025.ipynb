    "\n",
    "* __Intrinsic Value__: The intrinsic value of an American option is the __immediate exercise value__. For a call option, it's calculated as $\\max(0, S - K)$, where $S$ is the current stock price and $K$ is the strike price. For a put option, it's $\\max(0, K - S)$.\n",
    "* __Extrinsic Value__: The extrinsic value, also known as time value, represents the additional value of the option based on the potential for future price movements before expiration. It is calculated as the difference between the total option price and its intrinsic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extrinsic value $E_{V}(t)$ can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "E_{V}(t) = \\text{Option Price} - \\text{Intrinsic Value}\\quad\\blacksquare\n",

    "Ok, so this has a strange sort of edge case: when the option is __out of the money__, i.e., the options has no intrinsic value, the entire option price is extrinsic value. Why would we be willing to pay for an option that has no intrinsic value? \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Why do people pay money for something that is \"worthless\"?__ The answer lies in the potential for future price movements. Even if an option is currently out of the money, there is still a chance that the underlying asset's price could move favorably before expiration, making the option valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As time moves towards expiration, the extrinsic value of an option tends to decrease, a phenomenon known as \"time decay.\" This is because there is less time for the underlying asset's price to move in a favorable direction.\n",
