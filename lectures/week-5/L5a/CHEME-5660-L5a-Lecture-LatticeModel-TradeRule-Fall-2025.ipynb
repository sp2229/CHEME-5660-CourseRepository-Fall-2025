    "* __What is a stock?__ An ownership share in a company. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH4oPjaPlkk) for a quick overview.\n",

    "* __What is an exchange-traded fund (ETF)?__ A type of investment fund (a basket of assets) that is traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. ETFs hold collections of assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv4pkivGvdU) for a quick overview.\n",
    "* __What is a mutual fund?__ An investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds are managed by professional portfolio managers and are priced once a day. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkP7Yk1bX3I) for a quick overview.\n",
