    "## Company Profile: Jane Street\n",
    "[Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com) is a privately held quantitative trading firm with approximately 3,000 employees. It trades across asset classes (equities/ETFs, options, bonds, FX, and more) on 200+ venues in 45 countries, and is a major market maker in ETFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Business model.** Jane Street (JS) principally deploys its own capital (proprietary trading) while providing liquidity to __institutions__ (e.g., as an ETF authorized participant/lead market maker). The firm is deeply tech-led (functional programming, ML, hardware acceleration) and emphasizes collaborative, firm-wide risk management. [Let's look at what the interns say about Jane Street.](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/internships/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Jane Street contrasts with Citadel Securities (CS).**\n",
    "While both Jane Street and Citadel Securities are leading quantitative trading firms, they have some notable differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client posture:** [Citadel Securities (CS)](https://www.citadelsecurities.com) handles approximately 40% of U.S daily retail trade volume for equity/option order flow. On the other hand, Jane Street is primarily proprietary and institution-facing (does handle some retail ETF flow). In June 2025: Citadel Securities handled 38.3% of US retail traffic, while Jane Street handled 11.6%. This data is from [Rule 605 reports](https://www.sec.gov/rule-release/34-43590) filed with the SEC. Here is [Citadel Securities Rule 605 filings](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/rule-605-606-statements/) and [Jane Street Rule 605 filings](https://www.janestreet.com/execution-quality-reports/). The field descriptions of the Rule 605 reports can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/files/oes_data-reports-sec_rule_605.pdf).\n",
    "* **Product emphasis:** Jane Street is especially synonymous with ETFs, while Citadel Securities is most identified with U.S. equities/options/FX market making and order flow.\n",
    "* **Scale & performance.** Citadel Securities took outside capital [in 2022 at a 22B USD valuation](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/citadel-securities-valued-22-bln-after-investment-sequoia-paradigm-2022-01-11/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). While Jane Street remains privately held with limited external disclosures, however, they disclosed larger trading revenue in recent years and exceptionally high trading volumes, particularly in ETFs. Jane Street expanded materially in Asia in 2024–2025 (e.g., Hong Kong).\n",
    "* JS optimizes for correctness/composability (functional programming [in OCaml](https://ocaml.org), proofs, internal seminars). CS optimizes for industrial reliability at scale (pipelines, hardware, exchange microstructure). Different flavors of intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's hard to say which firm is better. Both places are rigorously selective, intensely quantitative, and very tech-forward. From an analytical perspective, here's how one might choose between them:\n",

    "> Pick Citadel Securities if you think: “Give me the biggest pipes in the market and the tightest latency/scale constraints; I want my math to survive brutal production realities and move national-level order flow. Optimization axis: CS leans more toward throughput/latency, capacity, reliability under load.”\n",
