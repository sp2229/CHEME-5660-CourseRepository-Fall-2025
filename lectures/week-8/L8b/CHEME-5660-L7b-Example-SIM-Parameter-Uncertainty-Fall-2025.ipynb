    "> * __Parameter estimation:__ We estimated $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters for all firms using ordinary least squares regression, computing 95% confidence intervals based on standard errors derived from residual variance.\n",
    "> * __Model evaluation:__ R-squared values quantify the fraction of a firm's growth rate variance explained by the market index, with values closer to 1 indicating stronger market correlation.\n",
    "> * __Uncertainty quantification:__ Bootstrap simulation results closely matched theoretical confidence intervals, validating our uncertainty estimates and demonstrating that parametric bootstrap provides a practical method for assessing parameter reliability.\n",
