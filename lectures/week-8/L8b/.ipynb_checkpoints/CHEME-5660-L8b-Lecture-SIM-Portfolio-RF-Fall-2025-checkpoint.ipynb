    ">\n",
    "> Every investor, regardless of their risk preferences, should hold the same risky portfolio, i.e., the tangent portfolio. What differs between investors is how much they allocate between this tangent portfolio and the risk-free asset. Risk-averse investors hold more of the risk-free asset, while risk-seeking investors may borrow money (making $w_f$ negative) to invest more than 100% of their wealth in the tangent portfolio.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This result is known as the __Separation Theorem__ or __Two-Fund Separation Theorem__, originally developed by James Tobin in his 1958 paper on liquidity preference. [Tobin, James (1958). \"Liquidity Preference as Behavior Towards Risk\". The Review of Economic Studies, 25(2): 65-86.](https://doi.org/10.2307/2296205) The investment decision (which risky portfolio to hold) is separated from the financing decision (how much to borrow or lend at the risk-free rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Practical Note: Concentration Constraints__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In practice, unconstrained tangent portfolio optimization often produces extreme weights in a few assets, especially with imprecise estimates. Practitioners commonly impose concentration constraints like $0 \\leq w_i \\leq u$ to force diversification. While these constraints theoretically reduce the Sharpe ratio, they often improve out-of-sample performance by making portfolios more robust to estimation error.\n",

In this example, we construct a portfolio that includes both risky assets and a risk-free asset, such as a treasury STRIPs bond. We will use the single index model to optimize the portfolio, aiming to minimize risk while achieving a specified return. We'll explore how the inclusion of a risk-free asset affects the portfolio's risk-return profile, construct the Capital Allocation Line, and identify the tangent portfolio.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lecture, we applied the single index model to portfolio optimization, demonstrating how SIM simplifies the multiasset allocation problem while preserving essential risk-return relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * __SIM reduces estimation complexity:__ The single index model requires only $2N+2$ parameters (alpha and beta for each asset, plus market mean and variance) instead of $N(N+3)/2$ parameters for traditional portfolio optimization, dramatically reducing estimation error for large portfolios.\n",
    "> * __SIM covariances are market-driven:__ Asset covariances are determined entirely by their market exposures through $\\beta_i\\beta_j\\sigma_m^2$, meaning all correlations arise from common market movements rather than direct firm-to-firm relationships.\n",
    "> * __The Separation Theorem simplifies investing:__ When a risk-free asset is available, all investors should hold the same risky portfolio (the tangent portfolio, which maximizes the Sharpe ratio) and differ only in how much they allocate between this portfolio and the risk-free asset.\n",
