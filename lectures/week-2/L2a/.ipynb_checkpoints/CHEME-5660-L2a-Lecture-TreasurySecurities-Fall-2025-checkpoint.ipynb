    "# L2a: Are Risk-Free Assets Really Risk-Free?\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduce the concept of risk-free assets, e.g., U.S. Treasury Securities, which the financial markets have considered de facto risk-free assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why do Treasury Securities exist?** The U.S. government spends more than it collects in taxes (budget deficit), so it needs to borrow money to fund operations, infrastructure, defense, and social programs. Treasury securities are how the government raises this money - essentially IOUs backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **When would you actually buy Treasury securities?** Safety (preserve capital when markets are volatile), liquidity (easily convertible to cash), diversification (balance riskier investments), predictable income (known cash flows), and tax advantages (exempt from state and local taxes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts that students should be able to define and demonstrate mastery of from this lecture are:\n",
    "* __U.S. Marketable Treasury Securities__: Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds are examples of fixed-income debt securities. When the U.S. Government needs to borrow money, it sells debt securities into the debt market at auction. These securities have long been considered risk-free (in some ways, they are, and in others, they are not).\n",
    "* __Really risk-free__? Treasury Securities are examples of abstract assets. These investments have current and future cash flow events (the type depends on the instrument), and they are priced such that the net present value (NPV) equals zero. The risk-free rate (the discount rate in the discount factor) is the IRR for these investments. \n",

    "Last time we introduced the ideas of the time value of money, abstract assets and the net present value. Let's do a quick review before we get started today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Value of Money, Discount Rates, and Discount Factors\n",
    "> __Time value of money.__ The buying power of money decreases over time. Thus, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. The present value of money has units of current dollars, and the future value has units of future dollars, where the conversion factor between current and future value is the discount factor, which is a function of the discount rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have $P$ USD today (units: current USD). Then, the future value $F$ (units: future USD) $k$ periods in the future is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "F = \\underbrace{\\left(1+\\bar{r}/n\\right)^{k}}_{\\mathcal{D}_{k,0}(\\bar{r})}\\;P\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $k = nT$ denotes the period index, $n$ denotes the number of compounding periods per year, and $T$ denotes the number of years. The conversion factor between current dollars and future dollars $\\mathcal{D}_{k,0}(\\bar{r})$ is called the __discount factor__, and $\\bar{r}$ is annualized __discount rate__. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Different Meanings.__ The discount factor and discount rate have many different meanings depending upon the context, and there may be different models for the discount factor. In our convention, the discount factor $\\mathcal{D}_{k,0}(\\bar{r}) = (1+\\bar{r}/n)^k > 1$ converts present value to future value. For present value calculations, where we convert future to present value, we use the inverse discount factor $\\mathcal{D}_{k,0}^{-1}(\\bar{r}) = (1+\\bar{r}/n)^{-k} < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Assets and Net Present Value\n",
    "> __Abstract assets__ are a useful __mental model__ for describing the financial value of a process, product, or investment over time. Assets are just described as current and future cash flows. However, there is a catch: money today is not worth the same as money tomorrow (purchasing power is not conserved). Thus, we must account for the time value of money when evaluating abstract assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net present value (NPV) is a method to value an abstract asset by calculating the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a specific time period. For a constant discount rate the NPV is given by:\n",

    "A U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill) is a short-term, _zero-coupon debt security_ issued by the [U.S. Department of the Treasury](https://www.treasurydirect.gov) with maturities ranging from a few days to one year. T-bills are sold at a discount to their face (par) value and do not pay periodic interest; investors earn the difference between the purchase price and the bill's value at maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What are today's T-bill rates?** Check current rates at [TreasuryDirect.gov](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/auctions/announcements-data-results/) or [Treasury.gov Daily Rates](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve). As of late 2025, a 6-month T-bill is yielding around 4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Where can I buy T-bills?** You can buy T-bills directly from the U.S. Department of the Treasury through [TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov), or through a bank or broker. You can hold to maturity, but they are tradable securities, so you can buy and sell them on the secondary market after the initial auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Why do we need a mathematical model to price T-bills?_ At first glance, T-bill pricing seems simple: buy at discount, get par value at maturity. But the key question is: _what discount?_ A mathematical model helps us determine the fair price based on current interest rates, time to maturity, and risk. This ensures you're not overpaying or leaving money on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how to price T-bills at auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auction Pricing of T-Bills\n",
    "At auction, a T-bill has two cashflow events. First, you purchase a Treasury Bill for $V_{B}$ USD at auction (now) and, secondly, at maturity $T$ years from now, you receive the face (par) value $V_{P}$ USD of the T-bill (future value). For pricing calculations, we use a semiannual compounding convention ($n = 2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The price $V_{B}$ USD, assuming a constant interest rate $\\bar{r}$ (discount rate) and a maturity of $T$ (units: years), is the discounted face (par) value $V_{P}$ such that $\\texttt{NPV}\\,=\\,0$ (written from _your_ perspective):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}  \n",
    "\\underbrace{\\texttt{NPV}(T,\\bar{r})}_{=\\,0} &= -V_{B} + \\mathcal{D}_{nT,0}^{-1}(\\bar{r})\\cdot{V_{P}}\\quad\\text{solving for price $V_{B}$}\\\\\n",
    "V_{B} &= \\mathcal{D}_{nT,0}^{-1}(\\bar{r})\\;{V_{P}}\\quad\\blacksquare\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{D}^{-1}_{nT,0}(\\bar{r})$ is the (inverse) _discrete multiperiod discount factor_ for compounding events $0\\rightarrow{nT}$. Assuming discrete compounding and a constant discount rate $\\bar{r}$, the (inverse) \n",
    "discrete multiperiod discount factor is given by: $\\mathcal{D}^{-1}_{nT,0}(\\bar{r}) = \\left(1+\\bar{r}/n\\right)^{-nT}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Quick Example**: You want to buy a 100 USD T-bill maturing in 6 months. If current rates are 5%, what should you pay? Using our formula: $V_B = 100 \\times (1.025)^{-1} = 97.56$. You pay 97.56 USD today and get 100 USD in 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Why not use continuous compounding?__ The U.S. Treasury uses a discrete semiannual compounding convention for T-bills (and notes/bonds) so we use the discrete multiperiod discount factor for our calculations. This is a convention, not a mathematical requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of how to compute the price of a T-bill at auction. We'll compare our calculated price to the actual auction price of different T-bills.\n",

    "[Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management) was a highly leveraged hedge fund founded in 1994 by Nobel Prize-winning economists and experienced traders that relied on complex quantitative models. At its peak, LTCM held over $1 trillion in notional positions with leverage ratios approaching 25:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What happened__? LTCM's highly leveraged fixed-income strategy was initially successful, with annualized returns (after fees) of around 21% in its first year, 43% in its second year, and 41% in its third year. However, in 1998, it lost approximately 4.6 billion USD in four months due to exposure to the [1997 Asian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis) and [1998 Russian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis).\n",
    "* __What was the aftermath?__ LTCM's losses were so significant (and connected to many Wall Street institutions) that they threatened the global financial system's stability (financial contagion). The [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org) organized a bailout by a consortium of banks and financial institutions to prevent a systemic crisis. The bailout was completed in October 1998, with the consortium providing $3.6 billion in capital to LTCM.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Credit Risk Models and LTCM__: LTCM's collapse highlighted the importance of credit risk modeling in financial markets. The fund's strategies involved complex arbitrage positions that assumed certain relationships between bond prices would hold, but they failed to adequately model the credit risk of sovereign debt during financial crises. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Russia defaulted, it created a _flight to quality_ that broke many of LTCM's assumptions about price relationships between different government bonds. Modern credit risk models attempt to quantify the probability of default and the expected loss given default for various debt instruments, including sovereign bonds. \n",
    "> __Corporate Models__: Well-known models include the __Jarrow-Turnbull model__ (which models default as a Poisson process), the __Merton structural model__ (which treats default as occurring when a firm's asset value falls below its debt obligations), and the __CreditMetrics model__ developed by J.P. Morgan. These models use statistical techniques, historical data, and market indicators to assess credit risk - topics that could be explored in our advanced course materials.\n",
