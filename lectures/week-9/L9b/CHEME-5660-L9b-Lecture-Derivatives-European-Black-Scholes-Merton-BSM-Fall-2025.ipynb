    "In this lecture, we introduce our next asset class: derivatives. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an __underlying asset__, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. They are widely used for hedging risk, or speculation.\n",

    "> [▶ Let's think about bandit based rebalancing models](CHEME-5660-L9a-Example-INFORMS-Fall-2025.ipynb). In this example, we'll explore bandit-based rebalancing strategies for a portfolio of risky assets. We'll reformulate the portfolio rebalancing problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each __asset combination__ represents an arm of the bandit. We'll implement an epsilon-greedy algorithm to decide when and how to rebalance the portfolio based on observed returns, and analyze the performance of this strategy in terms of cumulative returns and risk.\n",
