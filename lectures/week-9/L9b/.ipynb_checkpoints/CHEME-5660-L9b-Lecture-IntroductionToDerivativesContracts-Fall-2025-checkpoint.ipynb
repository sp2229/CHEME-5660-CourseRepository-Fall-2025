    "## What is a Derivative?\n",

    "\n",
    "Common types of derivatives include:\n",
    "* __Futures contracts__ are legal agreements to buy or sell an underlying asset, such as commodities, equities, or other securities, at a predetermined price on a future date. Futures are exchange-traded.\n",
    "* __Forward contracts__ are similar to futures but are traded over-the-counter (OTC) and have more flexibility in contract terms; they may have non-standard terms.\n",
    "* __Swaps__ are derivative contracts in which one party exchanges or swaps one asset's value or cash flows for another. Swaps are traded over-the-counter (OTC). \n",
    "* __Options contracts__ give the contract buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a specific price. Options are exchange-traded. The largest options exchange is the [Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)](https://www.cboe.com).\n",
