In this example, we'll explore bandit-based rebalancing strategies for a portfolio of risky assets. We'll reformulate the portfolio rebalancing problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each __asset combination__ represents an arm of the bandit. We'll implement an epsilon-greedy algorithm to decide when and how to rebalance the portfolio based on observed returns, and analyze the performance of this strategy in terms of cumulative returns and risk.\n",

    "## What is a Derivative?\n",
    "A derivative is a financial contract between a buyer and a seller that describes an agreement to transact an asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date, whose value is based on the performance of an underlying asset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's watch a short video to understand the concept of derivatives better: [Derivatives Explained in 2 Minutes in Basic English | 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0jeGk5GJX0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common types of derivatives include:\n",
    "* __Futures contracts__ are legal agreements to buy or sell an underlying asset, such as commodities, equities, or other types of securities, at a predetermined price on a future date. Futures are exchange-traded.\n",
    "* __Forward contracts__ are similar to futures but are traded over-the-counter (OTC) and have more flexibility in contract terms; they may have non-standard contract terms.\n",
    "* __Swaps__ are derivative contracts in which one party exchanges or swaps one asset's value or cash flows for another. Swaps are traded over-the-counter (OTC). \n",
    "* __Options contracts__ give the contract buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a specific price. Options are exchange-traded. The largest exchange for options: [Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)](https://www.cboe.com)\n",
