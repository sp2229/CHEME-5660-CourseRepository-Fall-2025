    "# L9a: Portfolio Rebalancing Strategies\n",
    "In this lecture, we'll look at tools that be used to rebalance a portfolio of assets. Rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio of assets. This involves periodically buying or selling assets in your portfolio to maintain a desired level of asset allocation or risk.\n",

In this example, we will calculate the Sharpe Ratio for a portfolio of assets using historical return data. The Sharpe Ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, which helps investors understand how much excess return they are receiving for the extra volatility they endure by holding a riskier asset. We will walk through the steps to compute the Sharpe Ratio and interpret its significance in portfolio management.\n",

We'll analyze how the drift impacts the expected returns and the associated risk of the portfolio and discuss its implications for investment strategies.\n",

We'll define specific risk and reward triggers that prompt rebalancing actions, and we'll simulate how these triggers affect the portfolio's performance over time. We'll also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using trigger-based rebalancing compared to other methods.\n",

    "In the last lecture, we discussed the Capital Allocation Line (CAL), which represents the risk-return trade-off of a portfolio that combines a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets. The slope of the CAL is determined by the Sharpe Ratio of the risky asset portfolio, which measures the excess return per unit of risk."

    "## The Problem: Portfolio Drift\n",
    "Once we have established an optimal portfolio, market fluctuations can cause the asset weights to deviate from their target (optimal) allocations over time. This phenomenon, known as __portfolio drift__, can lead to unintended risk exposures and suboptimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does drift occur?\n",
    "The weight (or _dollar fraction_) of asset $i$ in portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\omega_{i} = \\frac{n_{i}\\cdot{S}_{i}}{\\sum_{j\\in\\mathcal{P}}n_{j}\\cdot{S}_{j}}\\qquad\\forall{i}\\in\\mathcal{P}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $n_{i}$ denotes the number of shares of asset $i$, and $S_{i}$ denotes the share price of asset $i$. The numerator is the value of asset $i$ in the portfolio, while the denominator is the portfolio’s total value. Thus, because share prices change, the optimal allocation $\\omega_{i}$ drifts over time if the number of shares of each asset stays the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ with $N$ risky assets, each initially allocated $w_{i}^{(0)}$ of the budget $W^{(0)}$ at time $t=0$, where the price of each asset at the time of allocation is given by $S_{i}^{(0)}$. After some time, the prices of these assets change, leading to new prices $S_{i}^{(t)}$ at time $t$. If we do not adjust the number of shares $n_{i}$ held in each asset, the new weights $w_{i}^{(t)}$ will be:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "w_{i}^{(t)} &= \\frac{n_{i} \\cdot S_{i}^{(t)}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} n_{j} \\cdot S_{j}^{(t)}} \\\\\n",

    "&= \\frac{w_{i}^{(0)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{S_{i}^{(t)}}{S_{i}^{(0)}}\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{j}^{(0)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{S_{j}^{(t)}}{S_{j}^{(0)}}\\right)}\\\\\n",
    "& = \\frac{w_{i}^{(0)} \\cdot (1 + R_{i}^{(t)})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{j}^{(0)} \\cdot (1 + R_{j}^{(t)})}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $R_{i}^{(t)} = ({S_{i}^{(t)} - S_{i}^{(0)}})/{S_{i}^{(0)}}$ is the __fractional return__ of asset $i$ from time $0$ to time $t$. The new weight $w_{i}^{(t)}$ depends on the initial weight $w_{i}^{(0)}$ and the returns (price changes) of all assets in the portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only way for the weights to remain unchanged ($w_{i}^{(t)} = w_{i}^{(0)}$) is if all assets experience __exactly__ the same return over the time period, i.e., $R_{i}^{(t)} = R_{j}^{(t)}$ for all $i,j \\in \\mathcal{P}$ (which is highly unlikely in practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "__TL;DR__: Even if we started with an optimal allocation, the weights will naturally drift away from their targets due to differing asset returns. But why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Why does this matter?__: If we do nothing, our portfolio is only optimal in the minimum-variance sense until the next trade, i.e., until the next market tick in which any of the assets in the portfolio $\\mathcal{P}$ experience a price change. Thus, to maintain a truly optimal portfolio, with our specific balance of risk and reward, we must rebalance it at every market tick. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous rebalancing is impractical for many reasons, e.g., transaction costs, taxes incurred from frequent trading, data processing requirements, etc. Therefore, we need to explore strategies that allow us to rebalance our portfolio effectively without the need for constant adjustments.\n",
