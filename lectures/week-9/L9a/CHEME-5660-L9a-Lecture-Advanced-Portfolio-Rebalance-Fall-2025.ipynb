    "## The Problem of Portfolio Drift\n",
    "Once we have established an optimal portfolio, market fluctuations can cause the asset weights to deviate from their target (optimal) allocations over time. This phenomenon, known as __portfolio drift__, can lead to unintended risk exposures and suboptimal performance.\n",

Thus, because share prices change, the optimal allocation $\\omega_{i}$ drifts over time if the number of shares of each asset stays the same. \n",

After some time, the prices of these assets change, leading to new prices $S_{i}^{(t)}$ at time $t$.
