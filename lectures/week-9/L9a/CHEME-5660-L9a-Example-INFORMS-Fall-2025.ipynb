    "# Example: Online Stochastic Bandit Algorithms for Portfolio Rebalancing\n",
    "In this example, we'll propose a stoachastic multi-armed bandit approach to portfolio rebalancing which a bandit algorithm selectes which assets to include in the portfolio, and an aoptimal Utility Maximization (UM) approach is used to determine the optimal weights for the selected assets. Thus, we are simultaneously addressing the asset selection and weight allocation problems in portfolio management.\n",
